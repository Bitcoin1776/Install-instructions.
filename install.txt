This instance of the JFK-RPC-Blockexplorer was installed on a $10 docker droplet on Digital Ocean but will work with any Linux distribution that supports docker along with docker for windows.

git clone https://github.com/Bitcoin1776/jfk-rpc-explorer.git

cd jfk-rpc-explorer

docker build -t jfk-rpc-blockexplorer . 

cd

docker run -p 3002:3002 jfk-rpc-blockexplorer

MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE COMMANDS IN EXACLY AS STATED INCLUDING PERIODS OR IT WILL NOT WORK!

I recommend putting it into another directory call gitDIRS so that they can be seperated from other directories.

To do that just type:

mkdir gitDIRS

cd gitDIRS

Then do your git clone in the current directory and cd out of it for the rest of the installation.
